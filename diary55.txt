or mortification of heap bone

I sent Alexander to Nezam ed
Din to tell him, that I feel
well, but only no taste  in my
mouth & bowels worked yesterd
a little & that I take nothing
but jelly, milk & soda & some
sweet lemon; and if also I can
take the Kola bitter as tonic
he said that I can take it once
& continue what I am using.
But at about 4 P.M. I began
to feel the wind working up
and digging on with pain.
At 5 I took a coffee cup of the
bitter Kola & this increased the
in to such an extent that
ould not stand it, the pain
ms to have come back
before, I had not had it
ce Saturday, I gave u
de at all, what could

soda & milk, sucked
but all in vain
so acute in the
that made me

at 10 ½ p.m. I
piece of soap &
ed very little, mild
ck, it is from the
o magnesiume; the
ll continues; I took a
f Effervescent Citrate of
sia, it calmed the pain
e & I could sleep for a
t time, & recommenced
on. ~


Light N.W. & cloudy,
The pain still continues, but
ot so severe ~ Alexander went
tell Nizam ed Din, he prescribed
me some Belladonna to take
5 drops in a cup of water every
two hours, he is astonished
to see the pain returning and
for no cause given whatever,
he told him to wait until
tomorrow & if the pain does not
got, he will have to bring with
him Dr. Bridgestock of the
English missionary society


Sister Emilia & Medoola my
step daughter called on me ~


The pain increased all
, I am only taking
the Belladonna 5 drops in

the water but it is scarsely
doing me any good ~


At 1 P.M. I made an injection
of olive oil, hot water & soap, and
it worked out very dark green
with some costiveness, it allayed
the pain only for an hour &
recommenced, I left off sucking
any sweet lemon or oranges, it
may perhaps be from it; I only
took a half cup of very weak
broth at 3 P.M. ~ The pain
however kept killing me until
the evening, when Alexander
went to tell Nezamed Din
of my state & sufferings; He
prescribed me 4 packets of
morphine & cocaine to be taken
every two hours, I applied hot
formulation & Linseed poultice
but did not allay the pain
; the morphine & cocain
did not also do much good
and sleep is impossible ~

The S.S. Ressafah left this

I feel well, no pain

only the jelly & milk ~

The Residency Subidar
of Sepoy guard who was lost
on the night of the 28
&
no trace been found of him
in spite of the vigorous searches
made by the Turkish Detectives
His body has been found
last night, stabbed about
a dozen times & buried in
a Khan at the Owena quarter
where Paraffin is kept and
a Watchman an Afghan
who watches there. It is
reported that, three men
(Indians x Afghans) and a

Woman carrying the dead
body came at night to
this Watchman asking
him to let them stop in the Khan
with their sick mother until
the morning when they will
take her to the doctor, the
Watchman objected firmly,
but after much persuasion
he let them come in, and
as soon as they were inside,
they drew their arms and
thretened to kill the Watchman
if he says anything and
they dug a grave & burried
the Subidar in it, and
they left; The body was
brought this morning to
the Residency Doctor's house
and and examined by Dr.
Con also Nizam ed Din the
Municipality doctor,
They say that the cause of his
murder is in connection with
his going after young boys, &
that the Kawas Kheder &
the fair boy the son of Dowd

1904
Feby

Messeyeh are connected in
it and they have already
been imprisoned ~ I heard
since the truth of the story,
that the murderers are
the whole guard of Sepoys
(24 of them) have perpetrated
the deed in their barack
(the Residency stable
behind Lynch's Khan)
that same night in which
he disappeared & after
having stabbed him with
beynots & daggers etc, they
carried the body to the beach
& took a goffa & went down
& landed at the beach of
the Nawab Ikbalood Dowlehs
house where the new
Residency is getting built
now & landed & went to
the Khan of the Paraffin
& buried it there; Among
the Sepoys there is one who
is the Nephew of the Subidar
who took part in the murder &
he is the man who divulged
the secret to Major Newmarch
It appears that the

Sepoys used to hate their
Officer & had animosity against
him for being treated badly
by him; It is not true
about the Kowas Kheder
or the son of Dowd Messeyeh
being imprisoned ~


Artin my nephew called
on us in the evening ~

the vomiting & could not

tell me exactly what it is, once
he said from forcing myself to
vomit, but I never did so,

from the effect of medicines
but it is not blood. He prescribed
nothing but only to have
a rest today, & not to take
much liquid stuff as
milk or soda, so as not to
cause vomiting, but only
the jelly & continue to Bismuto
Magnesium ~

Ali Beg son of Bahram Beg
our supposed robber of our

Wife since last week has
begun to build a second
story over his little piece of
ground next & southward

& got it up in a level with
her terrace, it is a nice
little house now with the
fine little garden in it, this
piece of ground of 10 or 11
yards breadth fronting the
river which we most foolishly
left unpurchased & for the
sum of 150 Liras the length
like our 37 yards, we made
a great mistake last year
in letting it remain his
property & now we regret

1904
Mch

immensely for such a neglect,
we would have got rid
of him & his brother bad
lot as they are drunkards
and debauchers he now
overlooks both our houses
and who knows who will
hire it as he does not live
in it but it is made to be
let he must have spent
over 60 Liras more in this
last construction, & he
does not possess one Lira
as his pay & that of his brother
are not more than 3 & 2/3
Liras a month respectively,
evidently it is from our
last robbery that has now
assisted him to finish the
house ~

went to see a new house
just built the one of the
Mezrakies now the

about Alexander's arrangement
yesterday with the executors
appointed lawfully, Yacoob
Eassayi, & Skander Aziz
by the Widow of Shekoory
Sayegh; & the settlement
of the partnership between
them; It appears that he
does not approve of it,
it being rather risky
here after for Alexander
to recover all the credit
they have from merchants,
they may refuse payment
or detain it, but it
would be better for

1904

Alexander to let them
also be responsible for
half of the claim etc,


I then called on Metty
the Clerk of the Mejidish
(who remained behind
this trip on account of
the death of his Aunt

I saw Mikha the Tindal

Appoplectic stroke he got
& perhaps will never recover
his speech completely;


Alexander went down in
a goffa at 4 1/2 P.M., I

in whenever I go out, so

Sister Medoola called on
us;


I do not feel well since
two days, this ungrateful
behavior of my wife &
the scandalous way she
is causing among the
people is very unbecoming
for a person like her and
for our name and reputation

Her infatuity and bad
temper, and also her arrogance
in the way she speaks &
threatens us, have become
so intolerable, it is very
curious that whenever
she sees one of her sons
or daughters come up from
Basreh, she gets so unmanageable
and does not care a
bit for us or for the
management of the house
as she did two years
ago, when Tookyeh had
come up & she also cast
us up & went to live with
her & went to Basreh
with her~ All this and
other misbehavior have
cased me much grief
& pain to see my wife
treating me in this
manner ~


Alexander came out riding

yesterday; he told him that
he spoke to Yacoob Oossy
& Risha Khaghak & they
are ready to come at 8 ½
AM; I went to Yacoob
Oosy’s house and found
him just returning so
I took him home & then
explain all to him
and what my wife wishes
to take away, her Kit by
proving & on oath that
it belongs to her and

she has bought them
with her own money
Reesha Maghak also
came & I explained to
him & we sent for my
wife, she came and knocked
at the door in such a
furious way, & scolded
my Indian watchman & a
bused him for
not having let her
come in three days ago,
she was so fearfully
enraged & in such a
language that I never
seen her doing so before
she pitched into Alexander
& called him every thing
she was in fact wild
& insolent, she went into my
room & began searching for
her Kit & close, I called her
out to sit down & to speak
to the two witnesses present
that is Yacoob Oossy and

1904
June

Risha Maghak, I then
explained to them all that
since she wishes to take
away all what belongs to
her she can do so, only
the Alyiets which I doubt
if they are hers, she will have
to prove and on oath,
she consulted, I took
them to our sitting room
first, where there are two
Blackwood Satin Spring
couches she had bought
for my son to furnish his
room & given to him as
present, she claimed them
and said she will certainly
take them & not give any
thing to her son; they were
carried away by Coolies
& servants of Rufail; she
then took away a glass
candlestick with sheet
& crystal hanging she

swore that it is hers &
had bought it from Rezooki
Toni Lessy; & that was
all she had, she tried
to take her enlarged photo
framed & hanged on the
wall I declined giving
it, it was sent to Paris
& enlarged by Alexander,
but she disputed, so I
threw it on the ground
& smashed it to pieces,
we then went in the
Oorsy, she found one empty
blackood box, she took &
some worthless objects
& her sewing machine
I locked that room then,
& went in the Kefesh Koin
she took everything away
as clothes, bottles of
Arack, Rose Water, Tbacco
for Narghile, small
Bahrein mats, washing
Jugs & Basins and

1904
June

other objects, which she
made me wild to see
her mean way and
greediness in depriving
me of everything, I
could see plain that she
wants to injure me as
much as she can out
of spite, she wanted to take the bedding and
pillows but I objected
most energetically and
resisted in not letting her
take them, she saw
from me that I was willing
to allow her to take away
things that she wanted &
she took advantage of
this; Had I not been
advised by Père Pièrre &
other members of my family
to allow her to take what
she wants I would not

let her do what she liked,
but to avoid the scandals
before these two persons
& before the servants and
coolies I kept my temper
but some times she
used to pass the limits &
she was in fact, robbing
me like a depredation
& plunder, by tearing
away every thing she
can lay hold off; even
my old clothes arriving
her kit she took away
in bundles. Even my t
wo cotton blankets she
would take them away
but I took them, all sorts
of small articles, cloth,
boxes, she swept her chest
& wardrobes, & the Doolabs
in the wall, so far she
went, that at times I used
to burst out with rage
& prevent her from

1904
June

such a plunder, I kept
quiet all for the sake
of my health & the scandal
so that people on hearing
of what took place not
to blame me; and
especially that Pere Pièrre
asked me not to say
any thing; & let her take
what she likes, she even
clamed my big wardrobe
saying that I had bought
it from her late son Michail
& a few days before his
death & never paid him
the cost, well this wardrobe
I had bought it with other
furniture belonging to
Colonel Mockler a year
before Michails death
& paid for it; she took
away a lot of crockery
about 15 large flat dishes
pretending all are hers

but not half belongs to
her only about 6 or 8
old fashioned round
dishes, she took four
dozen plates dinner and
desert with flowers and
gilted round I had bought
from Asfar Khan
& she claimed them as hers
& had the courage to
swear that they were
hers, she wanted to take
my 6 gilt tumblers, but
I go so enraged that I
threw them & smashed
them all; she stole
from my other cupboard
a long linnen table
cloth & a dozen napkins
just 10 minutes before
& concealed them in her
Box with the other kit
and when I came to

1904
June

look for them I could
not find them & I asked
her then she said that
they belonged to her,
I told that I had bought
them from Angoorly at
Basreh & insisted in having
them she then took them
out of the box & gave them
up; in fact she was
trying to rob me as much
as she could; the copperware
pots, basins, two mankals
trays, washing basins
& all copper utensils she
took by saying & swearing that
she had made them
with her own money
I retained by force one
copper pot, belonging to
Alexander which, he
had brought with him

from Aleppo; & I have
four my own also brought
there from Diarbekir
& Aleppo which are out in
my new house using them
she took away what
flour, rice & ghee there
was saying that she
had bought that for
Rufail’s marriage,
she took some old carpets
& besaats from the Serdab
& finished this bloody
comedy before the coolies
servants & Yacoob Oossy
(Risha had gone at 1 P.M)
which lasted till 2 ½ P.M.
& we had not taken breakfast,
& she left the house in
a very tyred & done up
state for having done
a very good days haul
& left by saying to me
goodbye & with many

1904
June

things, I was glad to
have finished with long
standing disputes &
had prevented me from
getting any rest & piace,
we then Alexander & I,
took our breakfast,
in

but in what a state of
excitement & disgust I
was as well as Alexander
and she did not let me
quiet, but kept sending
the servant after such
& such article not taken,
she sent for her single
Iron bedstead from the
terrace which I loosend
& sent to her; she only
posseses one & it is out
in my new house, but
swore that she had this
for the last 20 years
What a scandal

she has caused in the
town among all the Christian
she has no shame, &
the fools of her brother Antone
& her son Rufail not
speaking to her & reproaching
her for such deeds which
are unbecoming to a
person like her and
at her age nearly 65
years to do such acts;


At 5 P.M. I called on my
sister Eliza & related to them
what took place they were
so astonished; Alexander
came there at 5 ½ and
